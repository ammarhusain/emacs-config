1. Make sure clang-format is installed (either through brew or via apt-get)
2. Make sure the google linter is pointing to the correct executable
3. Had to change Terminal setting on Mac:
   Preferences->Profiles->Keyboard .... Enable the "Use Option as Meta key"


- Install rtags ... was a pain in the butt. Got it to work by setting the LIBCLANG_ROOT_SIR environment variable
- Install Irony mode and irony-mode-server ... Got it to work by adding -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/usr/local/opt/llvm

Works with emacs25.2


;; Startup from clean system
sudo apt-get install clang cmake irony-server clang-format libclang-dev

; to try
sudo apt-get install clang cmake clang-format libclang-dev
M-x irony-install-server
